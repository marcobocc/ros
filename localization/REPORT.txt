2. FILE DESCRIPTIONS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

gmapping.launch
---------------
Launches gmapping and the rviz window with the gmapping_visualizer.rviz config. 
The bag should be started after launching this .launch file.

localization.launch
---------------
Launches gmapping and the rviz window with the localization_visualizer.rviz 
config. The bag should be started after launching this .launch file.

map.jpg
-------
Map generated on bag 3. The .jpg file is only for quick visualization 
purposes. The code actually uses the .pgm map.

map.pgm
-------
Map generated on bag 3. The code uses this file and not the .jpg one.

3. HOW TO LAUNCH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DISCLAIMER: Project was developed and tested on the ORIGINAL bags (not the 
remapped ones).

	3.1. RUNNING GMAPPING
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	For mapping, first run:

	:	roslaunch my_localization gmapping.launch

	Then launch the desired bag.


	3.2. RUNNING LOCALIZATION
	----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	For localization, first run:

	:	roslaunch my_localization localization.launch

	Then launch the desired bag.
	
	WARNINGS: The warnings during localization (missing transform between
	camera_pose_frame and base_link at current time) is likely due to a mismatch
	between the frequency of the various measurements. In any case it was 
	observed to not have a negative impact on the localization, and everything
	should be working properly.
	

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. CALIBRATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The missing transform between base_link and laser was found experimentally
by manually tweaking the transform until an acceptable tf was found. The 
appropriate transform was found to be a 90Â° rotation about the vertical axis.
This transform was used for both gmapping and localization.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. GMAPPING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The map was generated on the 3rd bag, because it seemed to explore the map
more thoroughly and thus could generate more precise maps.

The gmapping parameters were tweaked until an acceptable map was found.
In particular, we noticed that the quality of the map could be slightly improved
by reducing the parameters concerning the laser range below the true laser range.
The motivations for this choice were:

	1. We saw that the laser scan kept picking up strange noise in the distance,
	even though it was clear from the laser scan that there was a wall/obstacle 
	inbetween (bottom part of the map). One possible guess is that the laser was 
	hitting semi-opaque walls/windows/doors. Reducing the laser range meant less 
	noise in the distance.
	
	2. We noticed that the robot explored the room quite close to the walls and 
	obstacles, thus lowering a bit the laser range had no effect on the actual 
	quality of the interior of the room.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. LOCALIZATION WITH AMCL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sensor fusion is performed both on the odom frame and on the map frame. On the 
odom frame, we fuse the manufacturer's odometry with the camera's odometry. On 
the map frame, we fuse the AMCL pose with the manufacturer's odometry and the
camera's odometry.

More specifically, on the map frame the measurements are fused in the following
way:

	The AMCL pose provides absolute (x, y, theta) positions.
	
	The manufacturer's odometry provides (x, y) velocities. The theta velocity
	was ignored because we noticed experimentally that better localization could 
	be achieved by using the camera's odometry for the angular velocity. On the
	other hand, the linear velocities were quite accurate.
	
	The camera's odometry provides the angular (theta) velocity. We noticed that
	the camera's odometry provided quite good angular measurements even though 
	its (x, y) positions and velocities were almost always very off. This is why 
	we choose to ignore the (x, y) positions and velocities of the camera's 
	odometry and just fuse in the theta velocity.
	
The IMU was ignored because it did not provide significant improvements ontop the
proposed configuration, and if it replaced any of the two sensors (with any
combination of sensors configurations) the localization was always worse. So, 
the additional overhead of having an IMU was definitely not worth it and good 
results were achieved with just the proposed configuration, with just a few
robot movements.

On the odom frame, the configuration follows the same ideas with the exception
that there is no AMCL absolute position. The absolute position is instead
supplied by the manufacturer's odometry measurements. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. INITIAL POSE AND COVARIANCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We noticed that the robot started pretty much in the same location in all bags,
but its initial rotation could change significantly from bag to bag.

The covariances for both initial (x, y, theta) were increased to 0.5 to reflect
this observation. This allowed the filter to trust less the initial estimate
and trust the measurements more, allowing for a faster and more accurate 
convergence.

However, from our sensor configuration, until the robot starts moving (and 
especially until it starts rotating), the robot is unable to align the map 
properly. This can be seen in the video demo (minute 0:54 and 1:57, link at the 
beginning of this .txt file), where the map is misaligned during localization in 
the very first seconds. Then, when the robot starts moving, the map aligns quite 
fast to the laser scan.

Note that even though the initial (x, y) covariances are also set to 0.5, they 
are able to quickly converge to the true (x, y) because the initial estimate is 
actually already very close the to true (x, y), so we are just underestimating 
our initial precision. The most troublesome estimate is the rotation, and
avoiding overestimating our precision for rotation is key to a fast and accurate
convergence.
